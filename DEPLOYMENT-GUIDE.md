## Phase 2: Prepare for GitHub

### Step 3: Initialize Git Repository
1. **Initialize Git in your project folder**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Create .gitignore file** (if not exists)
   ```bash
   echo "node_modules/
   dist/
   .env
   .DS_Store
   *.log" > .gitignore
   ```

3. **Add all files to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

## Phase 3: Push to GitHub

### Step 5: Connect Local to GitHub
1. **Add GitHub remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/skyways-airline-reservation.git
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify upload**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - You should see all your files

## Phase 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 6: Set Up GitHub Pages
1. **Install gh-pages package**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. **Update package.json**
   Add these lines to your package.json:
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/skyways-airline-reservation",
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update vite.config.ts**
   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     base: '/skyways-airline-reservation/',
     optimizeDeps: {
       exclude: ['lucide-react'],
     },
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages"
   - Click "Save"

### Step 7: Access Your Live Site
